This project is made to finnish company named [Raute](https://www.raute.com/investors/). Raute is global maker of veneer, plywood and LVL technologies. 

The assignment in this project was to **predict** veneer sheet shrinkage after it had been dried and create a full pipeline for predicting shrinkage from preprocessing raw data, pretraining **neural network**, doing inference training in distributed training environment and to creating web user interface for the inference training. 

The whole project is divided into **three teams** and this is the first team (beginning of the pipeline).

## Team Network Training

### The objectives of the team briefly
Preprocessing raw data and pretraining neural network. After that, saving clean data to database. Our main task was to preprocess the raw data and to create a pretrained neural network model, which could be used in inference training by the second team which implements the distributed system.


### Note
- The **data** has, of course, been removed from this repository for privacy reasons.
- Most of the **documentation** has also been removed.
- This repository has two branches.
