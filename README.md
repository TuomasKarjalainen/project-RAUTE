This project is made to finnish company named RAUTE. RAUTE is global maker of veneer, plywood and LVL technologies. 

The assignment in this project was to **predict** veneer sheet shrinkage after it had been dried and create a full pipeline for predicting shrinkage from preprocessing raw data, pretraining **neural network**, doing inference training in distributed training environment and to creating web user interface for the inference training. 

The whole project is divided into **three teams** and this is the first team (beginning of the pipeline).

## Team network training

### The objectives of the team briefly
Preprocessing raw data and pretraining neural network. Therefore, our main task was to preprocess the raw data and to create a pretrained neural network model, which could be used in inference training by the second team.
